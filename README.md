# Usage (OpenMW Exclusive)

Simply run the script ( or exe if downloaded ) and place the generated plugin `LightFixes.esp` in some data files path. Make sure you load the plugin 
last! If you would like to customize the lighting settings make sure the `waza_lightfixes.cfg` is in the same directory as the executable, then after editing 
this configuration run the app to regenerate the plugin file.
